NALP make it easy for you to plot out exactly where you were and what you did and the total 
cost of all those activities so that maybe someone else can see your itinerary and give it a 
shot (or even tweak it to to suit their needs).

Getting Started:
1. npm install
2. download mlab and create a mlab account
3. in mlab - set a admin login/password and name your database
4. get a yelp API key
5. create a .env file with 
DB_URL = mongodb://ADMIN_LOGIN:PASSWORD@COPY_DBASE_URL_FROM MLAB
yelpToken=YELP_KEY_HERE
6. get your own Google Maps API key
7. in public/partials/plan.html, fill in your API key in this line:
<script async src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=YOURAPIKEYHERE&callback=initMap">
8. npm start
9. open localhost:3002 in your browser
